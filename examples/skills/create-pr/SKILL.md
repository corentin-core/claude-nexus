# Create Pull Request

Create a well-documented pull request with proper linking to issues.

## Arguments

## Instructions

### 1. Gather context

```bash
# Current branch
git branch --show-current

# Commits on this branch
git log origin/main..HEAD --oneline

# Changes summary
git diff origin/main...HEAD --stat
```

If an issue number is provided, fetch issue details:

```bash
# GitHub
gh issue view <number>
# GitLab
glab issue view <number>
```

### 2. Review the changes

```bash
git diff origin/main...HEAD
```

Identify:

- Main changes and their purpose
- Files that might need explanation for reviewers
- Any trade-offs or design decisions made

### 3. Ensure branch is pushed

```bash
git push -u origin $(git branch --show-current)
```

### 4. Create the PR

```bash
# GitHub
gh pr create --title "<type>: <description>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'

# GitLab
glab mr create --title "<type>: <description>" --description "..."
```

### 5. Title format

- `refactor: extract common logic to base class`
- `test: add tests for forecast module`
- `docs: update README with usage examples`

## Tips

- Link the issue properly (`Closes #X` for auto-close on merge)
- Mention any areas where you'd like specific feedback
- If the PR is large, consider suggesting it be split
